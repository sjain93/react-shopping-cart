# Colour Palette Builder

## Setup

### Project/Package

At present, to streamline the startup process for students, the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) libraries are attached directly to the HTML page using `<script>` tags.

### Editor

The suggested code editor for this project is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). To run the application, install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension and follow the instructions for starting a live server (`right-click` > `Open with Live Server` should do it).

### Browser

There are plenty of developer tools that aid in the development of React. At minimum, install the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) for Chrome, [developed by Facebook](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) (click to see Github code & docs).
